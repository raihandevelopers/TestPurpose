                <h3>8. Representations and Warranties</h3>
                <p>PinkSurfing cares about your privacy. However, you must understand that the PinkSurfing ecosystem provides a portal to execute your various functions on a decentralized network which specifically rely on Ethereum’s blockchain. Decentralized means that the transfer of money or data has features that are unchangeable and not controlled by any specific body. A decentralized blockchain like Ethereum is a technology that attempts to make transactions honest and conducts ledgering. We use blockchain extensively on this platform so that your transactions are all documented onto a blockchain network. Whenever there is exchange of cryptocurrency from fiat to cryptocurrency or vice versa, this happens through third party exchange and it is ledgered on ethereum’s blockchain and there is a fee associated with each transaction made. Your data however needs also to be stored on a database level, like for our ecommerce platform, otherwise the cost of these fees would be high to operate this ecosystem. We specifically use a hyperledger for this purpose. PinkSurfing is using blockchain to store data for a trustless protected ecosystem where the statistics cannot be manipulated through ethereum blockchain which is running on hyperledger besu. PinkSurfing can control if an account is allowed to be active or not, if we find that illegal activity is being conducted, but PinkSurfing cannot delete data or stop transactions and also cannot reverse transactions. This is implicit in how blockchain works. When you want to purchase cryptocurrency, our platform executes it on the Ethereum Blockchain via third party exchanges that are regulated to allow such transactions. And we provide a myriad of services so that you can move this money within the app by purchasing items, selling your own services or items, sending cryptocurrency or receiving cryptocurrency.</p>

                <p>When a transaction is made, the parties involved can have access to the documented information (called a Ledger) but cannot be changed. This makes it much harder to hack because many different computers (called nodes) store information of all transactions occurring when using PinkSurfing. This will create a database for us to learn your behaviors. Within the app, since a private blockchain is used, only the parties involved in the transaction, and PinkSurfing, can view the details of the transaction. Other users, including users outside of the PinkSurfing platform can view only the time, date and that a transaction has been made but not the personal data of the transaction.</p>

                <p>PinkSurfing’s Privacy Policy describes our information practices, including the types of information we receive and collect from you and how we use and share this information.</p>

                <p>You agree to our data practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in our Privacy Policy, as well as the transfer and processing of your information to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where you use our Services. You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country. You must look into your applicable laws in your country thoroughly. Use of our platform, holds and indemnifies, PinkSurfing harmless for any laws your state or country imposes on you that you chose not to follow, if there is conflict. This means if you do not know, or did not look into thoroughly, or something changes for you to misunderstand, then you take full responsibility. If you are at all unsure, please look into your state or country’s rules or regulations thoroughly before using our platform and continue over time to do so to maintain using our platform. We say this for you to protect yourselves. It is our intent to provide benefit to you and your life from the basis of this platform being a state of Delaware company born in the United States. Stop using our platform, or stop using the specific Service if applicable,  that is in conflict with your state or country as soon as it may arise. And please understand that rules and regulations around blockchain and cryptocurrency are rapidly changing and differ from one country to another, therefore you must keep up to date with your country’s applicable laws at all times, and follow those rules there-in set forth. You accept any and all negative impact that happens as a result of any change your state or country imposes, and indemnify and hold PinkSurfing harmless, just as you accept any advantage your state and country may give you by favorable laws to conduct business through PinkSurfing.</p>

                <p>When you process information that identifies or can have the capability to identify another individual using PinkSurfing’s Services (including the information PinkSurfing collects on your behalf), you agree to comply with applicable laws regarding the use, collection, protection, disclosure, and retention of this information. You acknowledge that you have reviewed and consent to PinkSurfing’s Privacy Policy, which explains our use of the personal information that you provide to us. For the state of California, United States business, please see the section below entitled specifically to California businesses.</p>

                <h3>10. The License that PinkSurfing offers you</h3>
                <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, limited, revocable, non-transferable, license to use the app platform and software to utilize the Services we offer you, as authorized in this legal document of Terms of Services. This license cannot be subleased. If software updates are made to the Services we provide, you must install and update to continue using the Services. At the time of updates, there may be additional terms that will be made known to you that you must additionally comply with to continue using our Services.</p>

                <h3>11. Assignment</h3>
                <p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses we grant to you here, may not be transferred or assigned by you in part or in full. Sometimes this is called a sublicense. Therefore, any attempt of transfer or assignment of a license or sublicense will be null and void at the option of PinkSurfing. If someone approaches you to sublicense these services, you are required to contact us immediately to notify us.</p>
                <p>Selling of a business that uses our Services to another party is permitted if following conditions are met. You must notify us immediately prior to such proposed transfer, and that person or entity must follow PinkSurfing’sTerms of Service in full as a prerequisite to use our Services regardless of ownership of the business that is in current use of our Services. That person must follow the same onboarding procedures first in order to qualify using our services. Selling of a business created that uses our Services, does not alone constitute ownership of the services we offer to the buying party unless we validate and approve the transfer to that person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate an Account at our sole discretion, however it is unlikely that we would do so. Please do not engage with suspected criminals to protect our community.</p>

                <h3>12. Intellectual Property Infringement</h3>
                <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and you are required to do the same. You cannot use material that infringes upon the rights of others.

                <h3>24. California Businesses</h3>
                <p>If you are a “Business” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq., (“CCPA”) then this provision 24 applies to you. For purposes of this Section 24, “process”, “sell”, and “business purpose(s)” have the meaning ascribed to them by the CCPA.</p>

                <p>a) For purposes of this Section 24, “Buyer Personal Information” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household that is processed by PinkSurfing in connection with its Services to you. Buyer Personal Information does not include information PinkSurfing receives about your customers (“Buyers”) for purposes of PinkSurfing’s digital receipt, customer directory and email marketing tools (“PinkSurfing Buyer Features”). It does include information that your Buyer has provided you through PinkSurfing Appointments, PinkSurfing Invoices, or to receive Loyalty-related or promotional text messages. For details about our privacy practices with respect to PinkSurfing Buyer Features, please refer to our Buyer Features Privacy Notice.</p>

                <p>b) We may receive Personal Information from Buyers for the purpose of performing Services on your behalf as described in these General Terms. We agree that we will process Buyer Personal Information collected, processed, stored or transmitted by, or accessible to us in the course of these Terms of Service, and other Applicable Terms of Service referenced above, only on your behalf, and for the purpose of providing you with the Services in these Terms and other applicable terms linked above based on the products you use. We acknowledge that we are prohibited from: (i) selling the Buyer Personal Information; (ii) retaining, using, or disclosing the Buyer Personal Information for any purpose other than providing to you the Services specified in these General Terms(s), and other applicable Terms of Service referenced above. As part of, and for purposes of, facilitating the Services, PinkSurfing may (i) de-identify or aggregate the Buyer Personal Information; and (ii) process the Buyer Personal Information for operational purposes, including, without limitation, verifying or maintaining the quality and safety of the Services; improving, updating or enhancing the Services either for you or for our customers generally; detecting and preventing fraud, and for protecting the security and integrity of our Services; and complying with our legal obligations. You acknowledge and agree that Buyer Personal Information that you disclose to PinkSurfing is provided to PinkSurfing for the parties’ business purposes.</p>
                <p>c) We reserve the right to delete Personal Information stored pursuant to these General Terms in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to our retention schedules.</p>

                <h3>25. Other Provisions</h3>
                <p>These Terms of Service, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and PinkSurfing regarding the Services. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other PinkSurfing agreement or Policy, these Terms of Service will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>

                <h3>26. Disputes</h3>
                <p>“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and PinkSurfing, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to these Terms or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.</p>

                <h3>27. Binding Individual Arbitration</h3>
                <p>You and PinkSurfing agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST PINKSURFING. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to a transaction intended for a personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in Anaheim, California, or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. PinkSurfing will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section for all claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the Arbitrator determines that your claims were frivolous. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and PinkSurfing also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City of Anaheim and County of Orange, California.</p>

                <h3>28. Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by Delaware law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act), without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.</p>

                <h3>29. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute</h3>
                <p>Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</p>
